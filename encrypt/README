Sample file encryption rw concept


To Run:

Dependencies:
sudo apt install libssl-dev
gcc

1)gcc encrypt.c -o encrypt -lssl -lcrypto
2)./encrypt
Encrypts all files found in sample directory, can be changed
Saves encryption key to a file named key.txt

To Un Encrypt
3)gcc unencrypt.c -o unencrypt -lssl -lcrypto

Next steps:
Containerize to run with local dependencies, not system dependant.
Make it so that encryption can traverse directories
