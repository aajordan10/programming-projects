This set of c programs traverses and reads a filesystem. 

1) Run gcc -o overview_program main.c initial.c contents.c
1)Run ./overview_program. The output of the high level directories will be saved to a file named overview.txt
2)Using the information gathered from overview.txt, you could run the "specific" program which will take in user input to further traverse a specific subdirectory and print out its contents.

For computational efficiency, using specific directories is less taxing than trying to go through directories you might not need or want to traverse.
The current directory you run these files from will be output to the current.txt file.
